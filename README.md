GetAround_Project
This project utilizes real data from the peer-to-peer car rental platform, GetAround. It comprises a web dashboard visualizing rental delays' impact and the potential benefits of implementing a minimum time between rentals. Additionally, there is an online API offering vehicle owners a comprehensive market overview and a price prediction tool based on Machine Learning and on data from other users.
